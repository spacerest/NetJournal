        <h1>NetJournal Writing Prompts</h1>
        <h3>What am I supposed to write about?</h3>
        <p>Write about whatever is in your mind. Check in to see how you're feeling -- are you hungry, thirsty, anxious, excited, bored? Are you procrastinating, and what exactly is it that you're procrastinating?</p>
        <p>The point of writing down these thoughts doesn't need to be to rationalize why you're going to a site that you, for whatever reason, feel like you go to too much. It's just to help you get a feeling for what patterns match up with each other.</p>
        <p>Like, do you go to Facebook when you're feeling lonely? Or hungry? At some point, I noticed that I was going to a certain website when I also happened to be craving sweets. What does that mean? I don't really know, but it makes me think that I was somehow using this website as a reward mechanism, and I would go there instead of eating something sweet since it was more accessible than ice cream if I was already on the computer.</p>
        <p>And I think that's ok, for what it is? But it helps me understand better what it is that I'm looking for when I go there. And I can figure out if I'm getting what I'm hoping for when I go there. If not, I should probably just go get ice cream, or go for a run, or whatever.</p>
