		<h1>About NetJournal</h1>

        <p>Thanks for trying out NetJournal.</p>

        <p>It is in it's rough beginning stages, but we'd like to get it in a more user-friendly form sometime soon.</p>

        <p>The point of NetJournal is pretty simple -- it's like a website blocker / productivity booster, but instead of entirely blocking websites, it just asks you to write down some thoughts before continuing to the website. The thoughts is, we go to certain websites (the ones that some people block when it feels they can't control themselves), for a reason. Instead of using an extension to block a site for us, hopefully we can examine our thought processes to see why we keep going there.</p>

        <p>It's good to find opportunities to be forgiving of ourselves and try to understand ourselves better.</p>

        <p>This first version of NetJournal is built on a a fork of <a target="_blank" href="http://einaregilsson.com">Einar Egilsson's</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector">Redirector</a>. Redirector is a robust opensource browser extension that lets you create any type of redirect under the sun (as far as I can tell). In this project, we only use a couple of the features built into Redirector. If you are curious about any of it, though, please take a look below at the <a href="help.html/#redirector-table-of-contents">Redirector Table of Contents</a>.

        <p>If you're interested in improving this project (either by fixing a typo, giving it some new features, fixing a bug, or improving its overall structure), please <a href="https://www.github.com/spacerest/NetJournal" target="_blank">check it out on github.</a> I can't put a lot of time towards it currently, but I would like to keep working on it since I've found that it's useful for me and I think it might be helpful for other people, too. It feels like so many things on the internet make money by commodifying our attention, and so I think it's important to check in with ourselves to see how we feel about that.</p>
